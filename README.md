# Library Management System

## Features

  * Web Application built on the combination of React, Firebase Firestore API, and Firebase Authentication API, hosted on Firebase. 
  * Session maintained throughout application.
  * Home page displaying books using pagination.
  * Cart implemented using redux.
  * Books can be borrowed if stock is available.
  * Only one copy of a book can be rented at a time.
  * Advanced search featuring sorting, filtering and searching.
  * Ability to view borrowed books and checkout history.
## Disclaimer
  * Advanced search was not done with infinite scroll pagination as it is not possible to search for books when data is loaded dynamically.
